## Task:

"A palindrome is a word that reads identically backward or forward. Consider the word “RACECAR”, what steps would you take to identify whether it was a palindrome? Write these down using concrete terms. Do the same for another word “DEFIED”.
Given the concrete examples, consider the generalized problem - informally describe an algorithm in English, that can identify any palindromes."
