This is contextualisation about the Ted Talk on "How computers learn to recognise object immediately."
This includes the benefits, limitations and risks of the subject in context of:

* Travel and Tourism
* Gaming and Entertainment
* Education and Learning
* Transport and Navigation
* Medicine and Healthcare

### Travel and tourism

One of the benefits of this system would be that it could be used in security cameras in tourist areas where it can locate suspicious items on people walking through the streets and also specific pieces of clothing to identify certain people. However in crowded areas where there are too many people at once, the security camera would either pick up too much information so the labelled boxes would cover everything or it would not be useful enough to catch any useful information because it might only be able to see the top of people's heads One risk to this could be the fact that with this technology public, this could allow people to spy on others or stalk them.

### Gaming and Entertainment

A benefit is that this could make it easier for people to monitor athletes in olympic competitions such as finding who comes first in a race how fast a competator ran or how high a polt volter volted etc. This technology could also be used to calculate people's heights quickly for entertainment facilites such as rollercoasters. A risk is that if incorrect, it could endanger the life of someone if they go on a ride that is not suitable for their height.

### Education and Learning

This technology could be used in field trips to help educate students about nature such as finding specific types of animals or rocks and learning what they look like. In the same way it could help babies to learn their enviroment more effeciently by giving them specific details on each object they find. It calso be useful for counting objects quickly. One risk is that it malfunctions and doesn't recognise objects accurately, without any adult supervision, it could lead to children becoming confused. 

### Transport and Navigation

This technology can be useful to highlighing specific signs or obstacles in hard to see conditions like during night time or a fog cloud. It could also locate obstacles around the car to warn the driver if something is behind or next to them when steering. One risk is that this feature can become distracting for the driver and take their attention off of the road for longer. Another risk is the fact that the system could mistake one thing for another and throw the driver off their course i.e the sun or moon could be detected for a yellow traffic light.

### Medicine and Healthcare

A benefit of this technology is that pathogens could be detected more effeciently through microsopes to help scientist carry out experiements. It can also help people who have bad eyesight to identify things around them that they may struggle to see. However, there is a risk that the technology could be incorrect with what it finds and could accidentally mistake one microorganism for another and ruin calculations.
